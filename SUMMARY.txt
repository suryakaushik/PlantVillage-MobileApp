1. Go to your android/app folder in terminal and create a debug key:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
The default password is android

2. Go to root folder,
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias plantVilaage_app -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

Move keystore to /android/app

in gradle-wrapper.properties,
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=release.keystore
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=alias
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=Password-Typed-while-creating-keystore 
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=Password-Typed-while-creating-keystore

3. Hop on to android/app/gradle.build and add the below code.

....Here some code resides

signingConfigs {
        debug {
            storeFile file('debug.keystore')
            storePassword 'android'
            keyAlias 'androiddebugkey'
            keyPassword 'android'
        }

       release {
            storeFile file('release.keystore')
            storePassword 'password'
            keyAlias 'alias'
            keyPassword 'password'
        }
    }

buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }

....Here some code resides

4. build the signed apk:
cd android
gradlew bundleRelease

It will take some time to build and you will get an .aab file in your android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab folder.
Now Google wants .aab file but Amazon and Samsung want an Apk. So to get an Apk simply run the below command to get an apk for testing purposes in the root folder of your app.

npx react-native run-android --variant=release

Now for production ready Apks do as below,

cd android
gradlew assembleRelease

You will get an Apk in the C:\Users\Gautham\notifier\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release folder.
